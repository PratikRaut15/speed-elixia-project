            <br>
            <p>1. <span style="font-weight: bold">Dashboard:</span> This gives you the pie charts with vehicles distributed according to their statuses.</p>
            <p>In addition, you have one more pie chart which distributes vehicles according to checkpoints.</p>
            <p>This helps you to understand if your vehicles are in warehouse/parking/client site etc. at one go, provided you have created checkpoints for such locations.</p>
            <p>2. <span style="font-weight: bold">Map:</span> By clicking on map, you will be able to see the real-time location of your vehicle.</p>
            <p>By hovering on the vehicles icon, you will be able to see the current speed and driver details.</p>
            <p>The vehicle icon changes colour depending on the current status of the vehicle.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><span style="color: #FF0000">&#9899 Red colour indicates over speeding vehicles</span></p>
                <p><span style="color: #009900">&#9899 Green colour indicates vehicles running at normal speed</span></p>
                <p><span style="color: #0000ff">&#9899 Blue colour indicates vehicles with ignition on, but standing idle at the same location</span></p>
                <p><span style="color: #C64E00 ">&#9899 Orange colour indicates that the vehicle has ignition turned off</span></p>
                <p><span style="color: #2F4F4F">&#9899 Grey colour indicates the vehicles that are not sending data, which may be due to low network/power cut</span></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>3. <span style="font-weight: bold">Real-Time Data:</span> Vehicle & Device tab shows the real-time location, current speed, distance travelled during the day, external battery status,</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&#9899 <span style="font-weight: bold">Location Report</span> gives you the location update for every vehicle for the selected time period.</p>
                <p>You may select whether you want the update every defined distance, or for every defined time period (i.e every 5 kms or every 10 minutes).</p>
                <p>&#9899 <span style="font-weight: bold">Stoppage Report</span> specifies where all the vehicle was standing idle for more than the specified time period, so that you can check unscheduled stoppages and control them.</p>
                <p>&#9899 <span style="font-weight: bold">Over speed Report</span> helps you understand the different locations where the driver over speed the vehicle, along with the over speeding duration and top speed.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>7. <span style="font-weight: bold">Alerts:</span> Unnecessary idling needs to be checked and hence, we have a new alert for you. You can define the maximum time a vehicle can remain idle,</p>
            <p>if within a checkpoint and if in transit and you will receive an alert every time the maximum duration is breached.</p>
