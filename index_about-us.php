<h3 class="btmbrdr2">GROWTH STORY & MILESTONES</h3>
<h4>THE EVOLUTION OF A REVOLUTION CALLED ELIXIA</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify";>The Elixia story begins when Sanket Sheth (our Founder and Managing Director) was working at a startup in the United States after his Masters in Computer Science. There, Sanket was solely responsible for building the entire backbone of the package tracking product which the company was providing to its elite customers. A small discussion with the founder of that company over a slice of pizza got Sanket thinking about the scope of technology and automation back in his homeland and soon, a la Mohan Bhargav in Swades, he packed his bags and came back to India for good. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify";>In June 2011, Elixia Tech was registered as a private limited company and, out of a small rented space, Sanket started working on his first product – Elixia Police – a mobile app for asset tracking. In due course as the team expanded and after understanding the market requirement, Elixia Speed – a vehicle tracking solution - was conceptualized, designed and developed. With time Elixia Speed as a product and Elixia Tech as a company grew, evolved and the rest, as they say, is history. All solutions that Elixia now offers are in line with the company’s vision of being an end-to-end logistics automation consultant and solution provider. In essence, every ‘Elixir’ (team member at Elixia) is essentially a problem solver and therefore the company by itself takes pride in providing solutions to the most critical problems that our customers face on a daily basis. Constant innovation based on customer feedback and designing solutions that hit the bull’s eye and solve the most raging problems has always been the key strength of Elixia. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify";>The fact that today Elixia serves more than 450 customers that include the biggest names in every industry segment speaks volumes of our growth, consistency and a never say never attitude. </p>

<h3 class="btmbrdr3">WHAT DOES ‘ELIXIA’ MEAN?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify";>Sanket originally wanted to name the company as Elixir Technologies. Elixir literally means Amrit, which is the utopian medicine that can cure all ills. Similarly, he envisaged that Elixir Technologies would be the company which would resolve all technological hindrances faced by people in their daily lives in order to make technology accessible to them and simplify their lives. Unfortunately, Elixir Technologies was already registered at the time, and thus, it was reincarnated as Elixia Tech Solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify";>In line with the company’s vision, every team member at Elixia Tech is referred to as ‘Elixir’ – with their primary purpose being to assist every customer to the best of their ability to resolve all their issues and simplify their lives every step of the way. This is the only binding thread of the culture at Elixia Tech where the ultimate focus is on customer satisfaction even if it means going out of our way to help them; and obviously, never say never! </p>
